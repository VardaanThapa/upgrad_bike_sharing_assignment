## General Information
- What is the background of your project?
    A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

    BoomBikes wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
    Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions
There are 10 significant variables identified to predict Sharing bikes demand - 
- year
- wind speed
- temperature
- is Season spring
- is Seasin winter
- is Month Jul
- is Month Sept
- is Weekday Tuesday
- is Weather : "Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds"
- is Weather : "Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist"

- The model is pretty good for prediction and does not show any over-fitting issue. 
- The model explains above 80% variance in the Bike Demand
